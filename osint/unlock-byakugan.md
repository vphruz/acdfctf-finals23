# solution
open the image</br>
to your right you'll see some kind of mall(inzovu mall)</br>
google search and open it up in maps </br>
i tried all the major landmarks i could see facing forward with regards to the picture</br>
then i purchased the second hint for 50 points</br>
that just gave us the answer</br>
google the hint</br>
Kigali Convention Centre</br>
then i had trouble submitting the flag. i contacted abzee (one of the support staff) and there was swift response and i was able to submit it. shout out to the support team!</br>
voila!
