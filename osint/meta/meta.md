Aduke said she wants to go get her phone charger somewhere, but it's been past 4 hours now, and she's yet to be back. I can't contact her, but she has a habit of noting her location in her little jotter.</br>
I checked and found this incomprehensible word* 'handrailearthblessing,'* and I don't know what to do with it. Can you help me find where she went?</br>

# solution
máº¹ta is 3 in yoruba</br>
take note of "location"</br>
a google search of the string "handrailearthblessing" doesn't yield a result but google suggests we seperate them into 3 words
when we search that and scroll down a bit we stumble across [this](https://map.what3words.com/about)</br>

going the homepage and typing the words, we realise we're meant to seperate the words by a full stop and have 3 forward slashes in front of the text</br>
click on search and we get:</br>
